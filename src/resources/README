Title: C195 Scheduling Software

Purpose: Follow outlined business requirements while creating a GUI based scheduling desktop application. I will use the provided database to communicate
with the scheduling software. I will meet all of the requirements outlined in the rubric including but not limited to: adding scheduling functionalities,
allowing the user to view the schedule in multiple views, providing error checks to ensure that customer appointments do not overlap, allowing the user to
edit, add and delete both customers and appointments.
